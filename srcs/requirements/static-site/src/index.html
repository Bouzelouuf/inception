  <h1>Inception Project - 42</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The Inception project is an introduction to system administration, containerization, and DevOps best practices. 
      You're tasked with building your own infrastructure using <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Docker Compose</strong>. 
      Each component (Nginx, WordPress, MariaDB, Redis, etc.) runs in its own container, isolated and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      🛠️ Think of it like building your own digital house — every service is a room, and Docker Compose is your floor plan.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Nginx</h2>
    <p>
      Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy. It handles HTTPS connections and forwards user requests to the appropriate containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      🔍 Analogy: Nginx is the receptionist that guides visitors to the right room while checking their ID (SSL certificate).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Redis</h2>
    <p>
      Redis is a fast, in-memory caching system. It stores temporary data like sessions or query results to reduce load on the database.
    </p>
    <p>
      🔍 Analogy: Redis is a whiteboard with quick notes — instead of asking the database every time, we look here first.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Adminer</h2>
    <p>
      Adminer is a web interface to manage your MariaDB database. It helps you view, create, and delete tables or records.
    </p>
    <p>
      🔍 Analogy: Adminer is the dashboard that lets you control and inspect your database without needing command-line tools.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>FTP (vsftpd)</h2>
    <p>
      FTP allows file transfer between your machine and the server. In this project, it's configured with TLS for security.
    </p>
    <p>
      🔍 Analogy: FTP is like a secure locker room where you can store and retrieve files safely.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This is a static HTML site hosted by Nginx. It contains information about each service in the Inception project. 
      It doesn’t use a database or backend — just HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      🔍 Analogy: It’s like a printed brochure – simple, fast, and easy to read.
